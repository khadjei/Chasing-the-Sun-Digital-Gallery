## About the Collection
This digital gallery contains twenty photographs of sunrises and sunsets from around the United States taken in 2022. It is designed to inspire people to pause and observe the visible beauty around them, and to exercise their own artistic and creative journey with photography. 

This collection was originally inspired by exploring the question of: how can libraries employ the arts to be hospitable spaces that foster reconciliatory conversations and encourage people to seek out and appreciate a greater understanding of themselves and the world around them, in order to envision and work toward a more beautiful future society? 

This question was informed by Makoto Fujimura’s [Culture Care: Reconnecting with Beauty for Our Common Life](https://www.ivpress.com/culture-care/). This book issues a call to cultural stewardship, in which people (re)discover their appreciation of art and artistic abilities in order to generate beauty, creativity, and generosity into cultures that so desperately need hope. By reaching across boundaries with understanding, reconciliation, and healing, people can serve others as cultural custodians of the future in order to help humans and culture thrive. This digital collection is a beginning attempt to materialize this call. 

From the creator of the collection:
Personally, as a self-proclaimed culture care steward currently working in library spaces, I want to work in and connect with more creative spaces and people in general, and I felt that this project would provide a starting point in learning how to create a library, at least a digital library, in order to be more effective in resourcing this group of users. In addition, I felt that this project would help me to provide a public space to share my own creative work, and dive more deeply into exploring my creative appreciations and abilities. As such, photographs of additional sunrises and sunsets may be added over time.

In a more professional sense, I am also equally as passionate about working with various Japanese populations, as a form of Asian Studies librarianship. Art and beauty are such important cultural values in Japan, and in terms of photography, many Japanese people love to take photographs of beautiful things around them for fun. However, one of the many social problems plaguing Japan is an extreme focus on work and social pressures to conform to the status quo, which negatively affect Japanese people’s interest and confidence in pursuing unique endeavors on their own. So, I think that this project will be a great way to understand how, as an information professional, I can use and promote an art form to both reach out to, inform, and encourage Japanese patrons to embrace and share their creativity as an activity that matters to society, in the vein of culture care.
